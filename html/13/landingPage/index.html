          <h3>Me (and what I like to do)</h3>
          <p>
            I like to do so many things! My favorite sport, and the sport I've been practicing for the last 13 years is <span id="aerial">aerial acrobatics</span> (that's more than half my life!). I am also a <span id="first">FIRST</span> Alumna. Thay are a non-profit organization that promotes science and technology education. After the army I decided to take sabbatical year and decided to pursue a passion of mine and learn how to be a professional <span id="pastry">pastry chef</span>! My personal pastry to make is a sourdough bread (with olives!).

          <h3>My Professional life</h3>
          <p>
            As a young Israeli I <span id="enlist">enlisted</span> to the army at 18. I took a cyber defence course and served as a cyber defender for a year or so. Then I decided to take a challenge and became a team leader (and a mama) for <span id="soliders">11 charming soliders</span>. It was a new team which really added to my challenge. After two years I wanted to change it up and took a new role (and unit) as an <span id="operations">operations manger</span> for a team leaders course. I got to raise the next generation of team leaders!
